                <p>I hate it here.</p>

                <p>Granted, I deserve it.</p>

                <p>I'm currently locked down behind massive, concrete walls and solid steel doors in a maximum-security penitentiary.
                  I was locked up what feels like a lifetime ago now. I earned it, I did. Every second I rot here is justice,
                  but that doesn't change the fact that I hate it.</p>

                <p>It is cold here. I have a single concrete cot and toilet. My clothes itch and are too thin to keep any chills
                  out. The walls are a grey with a sickly green tint due to the dull, swamp-like tile that sends a grossly
                  colored glow into the room reflecting the buzzing florescent light above me. The door is thick and unmoving.
                  They paint it the same shade of sickly green as the floor. I assume it is lead based to save on cost. (Maybe,
                  if I lick it enough times, maybe I can kill enough brain cells to forget Iâm here.) I have no roommate,
                  as many donât who are perceived as âextreme risks.â Thankfully I can still have time outside and shower
                  without being entirely supervised. More than I can say for many in here.
                </p>

                <p>My only commodity is my toilet paper and my journal. I earned the journal through much work and good behavior.
                  The pencil I write with is dull and has no eraser; like that a golfer would use to keep scorecards. I am
                  allowed 4 hours per day with it: between breakfast and lunch. I receive the journal and pencil with my
                  meal and return it in kind. If the pencil has any pieces missing or there are any extensive tears in the
                  pages then I will lose it for the following day. So I comply. I comply so I may have some mild comfort
                  in this concrete cage in which I slowly die.</p>

                <p>Again, I definitely earned it, but that doesn't change the fact that prison is hell.</p>

                <p>I earned my place here because I killed people.</p>

                <p>I killed many people.</p>

                <p>I killed 20 people to be exact.</p>

                <p>This is the first time Iâve actually written it.</p>

                <p>I beat the Cannibalâs number, which for some reason gave me a sense of accomplishment. However, what gave
                  me more satisfaction was the evenness of the number. Twenty.
                </p>

                <p>Two, ZERO.</p>

                <p>20</p>

                <p>20</p>

                <p>2 0</p>

                <p>2-0</p>

                <p>2....0</p>

                <p>20</p>

                <p>Even and smooth.</p>

                <p>My Compulsion made it this way. 21 would have made getting arrested a living hell. 15 wouldâve been ok, but
                  20 was much cleaner. Increments of five. Always increments of five. Sometimes during a shopping trip I
                  would grab a stick of gum so as to have 20 or 10 or 30 items even. However, in the case of the killings
                  it was much more intense.</p>

                <p>The problem was the itch I felt in between. It was a gnawing pain in my mind from 1-4 and 6-9. The itch was
                  not as bad during 5âs but 10âs were the best. However, that number will eventually attract attention. That
                  number is partially what got me caught, but I had to âscratch the itchâ so to speak. It made me empathize
                  with vampires in the old horror stories- the sensation of aching thirst that cannot be quenched. It is
                  nightmarish.
                </p>

                <p>The same remained true for my age: 40. I finished at 40, which made me content. I hated not having an even
                  age. I could force down the bad feelings my age ended in 5s or even numbers but I always had bad years
                  with 1s, 3s, 7,s and 9s.</p>

                <p>I digress. I understand it is abnormal behavior, but itâs a compulsion. I have it manageable so that most
                  would never notice in a day to day routine.</p>

                <p>I have to reminisce on these pages because I have no way of going back. It started many years ago, and the
                  urge only grew from there.</p>

                <p>The first time I killed was interesting. I should have felt the need to immediately kill again, as I did
                  in later years, but I didnât. They say mental illness worsens with age. I guess thatâs what kept me from
                  acting again so soon, but Iâm not sure.</p>

                <p>The first time I killed was pretty lackluster. . I was walking home from school through the woods where very
                  few kids were bold enough to cross. While walking, I stumbled upon a man. He was clearly injured and even
                  at the age of 12 I knew he had little time left. He sat, holding his side, panting in labored breaths.
                  He didnât see me yet. From my vantage point I could see a long, white bone jutting from his leg, which
                  tells me the pain from what his ribs were doing was worse than that of a broken leg. That, or he was just
                  in shock.</p>

                <p>Far above this section of woods was a road, and from what I could see a vehicle burst through railing. The
                  wrecked vehicle, a â69 Chevy C20 truck, lay decimated some 40 feet below the roadway in the brush and rocks.
                  I remember this truck, because I wound up purchasing one many, many years later in a secret nostalgia for
                  myself. Either way, the driver had pulled himself from the wreckage and crawled in agony upwards of 50
                  feet to the nearest tree, where his strength was slowly failing him.</p>

                <p>I remember seeing a large shard of metal which had been ripped from the side of the truck and picking it
                  up. I walked slowly to the man who reached pitifully towards me for help. I slowly shoved the sharp edge
                  of the metal into the manâs throat and watched as blood began to spurt from the wound and his mouth. He
                  gargled like a drowning sow on his own blood, and after a time he ceased all movement, forever.</p>

                <p>It was a rush of which I cannot explain. The excitement of ending a human life is next to none. I was content
                  for a fleeting moment. I stared at the body for some time before taking a bloody shred of his pant leg
                  that was hanging by a thread. I just wanted to have a keepsake.</p>

                <p>That was my first kill. I was never caught, nor even suspected. Growing up in the mountains of the south
                  allowed much privacy, and it allowed me to get away with murder. As time grew, so did the feeling of power
                  and accomplishment. I felt like God.
                </p>

                <p>No one even knew I was the way I was. I would never be a suspect, because I knew to hide.</p>

                <p>I hid well, because I knew how to hide. From the time I was a boy I knew how to blend in. Sometimes it was
                  a challenge because of my appearance, but I learned a simple skill: how to hide in plain sight.</p>

                <p>I was able to work hard in the background. I made good grades and maintained very few close friendships throughout
                  school, so no one would discover anything about me. However, I made sure everyone had a nice thing to say
                  about me, carrying groceries, helping kids with studying, always using manners. I graduated in the upper
                  ranks of my class and soon attended the local college. After I earned a degree in business, I worked hard
                  where I could and raised enough money to buy my own Rig. I worked by riding the highways as a trucker for
                  years and eventually bought 2 more rigs. By 35 I was a respectable business owner in my old town with a
                  dispatch and a few drivers. I obviously still drove, even as the owner, because it kept me close to my
                  only real passion.</p>

                <p>I hid well in plain sight because white people love a nigger. In a town of 90% white and 10% âotherâ I learned
                  to blend despite being a minority. Learn to talk like them, learn to walk like them and you can manipulate
                  them into whatever you want.</p>

                <p>I hate them. Not white people; all people.</p>

                <p>My mother died shortly after I graduated high school from heart failure, and I felt liberated, for I held
                  her opinion highly. Her opinions often kept me in line and respectable. When she died, I was free to pursue
                  my own interests. My father, while a good man in his own right, never held much weight in my actions, so
                  I walked the path I chose for myself despite what his feelings may be.</p>

                <p>Either way, I dwindled for some time after the first murder. The urge slowly grew. By high school I kept
                  my eyes peeled for another opportunity to snuff out a life. Finally, that day came.</p>

                <p>The second time I murdered was equally uninspiring. I found myself at a graduation party and the whole senior
                  class was drinking heavily. All except me that is. We were at the home of a wealthier student who had maintained
                  a spotless record through both junior high and high school and wanted to go out in a way where she could
                  get out of her preverbal box.</p>

                <p>I learned two things that evening. The first, that a well mannered, well educated young lady was no different
                  than anyone else in regards to having a darker side. She wanted to be remembered for a party. Not her good
                  grades, not her generous deeds, not her modest manner of dress, but a party. Everyone has a dark side in
                  some way. This was the first thing I learned. The second was that if everyone is drunk and dancing on the
                  roof, you could bump a certain young lady discreetly enough to send her three stories down into the concrete
                  and make it look like an accident. She landed with a smack that can only be replicated in my dreams. This
                  was the first time I was aroused by a killing. Iâm not sure why. She was in a two-piece (which I assume
                  her parents knew nothing about) and her skin was pale, and smooth. Her deep brown hair flowed past her
                  shoulders and the look of utter confusion and terror in the face of innocence was priceless. Blood pooled
                  from her head and seeped into her nearby swimming pool. I fancied her you could say, but only because she
                  represented something that does not exist. Human innocence. When her skull cracked hard against the pavement,
                  I was instantly excited. I had to sneak away to handle it, and steal a memento from the girlâs room. Meanwhile,
                  the remaining partygoers descended into madness trying to repair a situation that was far beyond broken.
                  The chaos I caused that night again resurfaced my deep sense of accomplishment that only comes from death.</p>

                <p>This was the second time I killed. 18 years of age. By the time I hit my stride I stood at 6â2â at 260lbs.
                  I had always enjoyed lifting weights and working towards my overall health. A fat predator is a bad predator.
                  I maintained this level of fitness for most of my adult life. I had to in order to pursue my passion.</p>

                <p>Of course, things would have a way of catching up with me. I was incarcerated with an unfortunate mountain
                  of evidence. I wouldnât say I covered every base perfectly to ensure not getting caught, but I felt like
                  I was careful enough. I guess not in hindsight.</p>

                <p>I remember the day I was arrested. I had turned 40 the month prior and was on the road delivering a shipment
                  of plywood. I was behind the wheel of my rig in rural Alabama. I was taking a back road because I enjoy
                  the scenery, and when youâre the boss you can set your own schedule. At this point, I had killed 19 people
                  and the itch was present. I would have to rub the back of my neck when I thought about it. It needed to
                  be scratched. I needed to take care of it.</p>

                <p>Thatâs when I saw her.</p>

                <p>Miles from any structure or any living person was a broken down, baby blue Volkswagen Beetle. The emergency
                  lights were flashing and a woman was looking into her engine compartment. The height of my Truck allowed
                  my to scan both her car, and the area surrounding us. It was tall, uncut grass and trees, covered in utter
                  blackness due to the overcast night. There was no one for miles and miles. We could be alone together.
                  I pulled in behind her, with my low lights so as not to scare her.</p>

                <p>When I stepped out of the truck I addressed her.</p>

                <p>âPardon me maâam,â I said calmly. I know how to disarm. I have worked on my speaking voice for years in order
                  to betray their security into my hands, âAre you alright?â She stepped out from behind her hood and I saw
                  her in better light.</p>

                <p>She was a young, Hispanic woman. Her clothes were tattered, but I think that was intentional. She had silky,
                  dark hair to her shoulders and black librarian glasses. She was pretty, which was a bonus for me. Consider
                  it like a dinner. Youâre going to get your meal, but when it includes dessert then it is all the better.
                  I also knew she could complete this cycle. She could be the 20th and I could rest. Best yet, she was petite,
                  so there would be little fight.</p>

                <p>âI think the engine is shot,â She said in a desperation that these dark woods certainly played well into.
                  She just wanted to get out of danger... little did she know.</p>

                <p>âI can give you a ride, I own this company so I can make the time,â I didnât want to sound presumptuous,
                  but I knew by making myself a manager it would remove the âcreepy truck driverâ mentality.</p>

                <p>âI donât know...â</p>

                <p>âI promise,â I edged, in my best âZip-a-Dee-Doo-Dahâ voice, âIâll take you straight into town and we can
                  find you a phone. My wife would kill me if I let a young lady stay stranded in the woods.â</p>

                <p>I wasnât married, but that is another way of disarming her. A spouse always makes a man less dangerous, or
                  again, as she thought.
                </p>

                <p>âOk,â She said, with her fear betraying her skepticism, âThank you.â</p>

                <p>âIâll get the door for you.â</p>

                <p>As she walked to the passenger side I held the door open for her. As she took her first step up I grabbed
                  her ankle and pulled her straight down with as much force as I could manage.</p>

                <p>Her jaw connected with the studded metal stairs full force. I know some teeth were broken by the crunch that
                  emanated from her skull. She fell limp to the dirt as I lifted her onto my shoulder. She didnât stir long
                  enough for me to grab a large socket wrench from my rig. I could feel the warm blood from her mouth pouring
                  down my shoulder.</p>

                <p>I carried her into the tall grass, just out of sight. We made love then. I had made love before to some,
                  but this was special. She was the 20th. She would complete the need. Halfway through she began to wake
                  and struggle. From there I had to act. I took the socket wrench and began to hit her. She struggled to
                  scream due to her shattered jaw. I hit her in her pretty face, over and over, and over and over, and over
                  and over, and over and over, and over and over, and over and over, and over and over, and over and over,
                  and over and over, and over and over, and over and over, and over and over, and over and over, and over
                  and over, and over and over, and over and over, and over and over, and over and over, and over and over,
                  and over and over, and over and over, and over and over, and over and over, and over and over, and over
                  and over, and over and over, and over and over, and over and over, and over and over, and over and over,
                  and over and over, and over and over, and over and over, and over and over, and over and over.</p>

                <p>When I had finished on all fronts I took her wallet from her jeans off beside us. Hannah, I believe her name
                  was. I took her glasses as the fell off when her face collided with my truck and avoided the wrath of the
                  socket wrench. They had her name engraved inside the temple.</p>

                <p>I drove. Leaving the scene entirely. I had to re-enter the highway some time later and saw lights in my mirror.
                  I had been stopped before. Once even with a body in the back, so I was not worried.</p>

                <p>The officer walked to the side and called me out. âYou Williams (my last name)?â He asked with an unreadable
                  demeanor.
                </p>

                <p>âYes sir,â I answered coolly, holding my id and paperwork for the truck and delivery.</p>

                <p>He then spoke into his radio.</p>

                <p>âYeah, we found him.â</p>

                <p>âOfficer whatâs this ab-â I was cut short.</p>

                <p>âSir, please turn around and place your hands behind your back.â</p>

                <p>âWhy?â I demanded, I was not about to be cuffed and restrained for no good reason.</p>

                <p>He then turned me violently to my truck and slapped cuffs around my wrists. From there He sat me on the pavement
                  and called for backup.</p>

                <p>When other officers arrived one finally noticed the blood on my back. They then found the glasses. They then
                  found the poorly wiped down socket wrench. They then received word of a brutal mutilation several towns
                  over.
                </p>

                <p>They had stopped me initially because one of my drivers was caught with a brick of marijuana and they wanted
                  to stop all trucks from my dispatch to make sure we were legitimate. It would be funny if it werenât so
                  infuriating. I was brought down on a technicality.</p>

                <p>My run lasted from 12 to 40. I was undetected for that entire time. I changed my MO. I killed strangers only.
                  I was so careful. A technicality was the only thing that could have done this.</p>

                <p>My simple home was turned about until they found my treasure box (a shoebox of souvenirs and news clippings).
                  From there it was easy to put me at every single murder. Every homeless person stabbed to death in cities.
                  Every transient prostitute with their heads missing. Every unsupervised child in crowded streets. I was
                  linked to them all.</p>

                <p>Now, one may ask, âWhy would you be so stupid as to keep mementoes?â</p>

                <p>To that I would say I had to. It was my passion and the only thing that gave me meaning. I had to keep something
                  around. They were the only memories I could have of those times.</p>

                <p>Like I first wrote, I deserve to be in prison, but I donât regret in the slightest what Iâve done.</p>

                <p>The trial was grueling and irritating. Since I killed across state lines there was arguments as to where
                  to have my trial, but it became a federal issue, which only meant more bureaucracy. My lawyer explained
                  many of the killings would be circumstantial at best, but just as many have my now connected DNA to the
                  scene and are going to be nearly impossible to deny. I decided to throw in the towel. The media was out
                  for blood, the public was out for blood, and the jury was out for blood. I had my fill, so now it was time
                  to pay the favor forward. There was no way to avoid a life sentence so I may as well come clean and get
                  regale the tales of my exploits to a room of terrified jurors and family members burning with hatred.</p>

                <p>Despite the difficulties of finding some evidence of murders, I was still convicted for 18 of the 20. However,
                  I was punished for them all regardless.</p>

                <p>The day of sentencing I stood still and stoic before the judge. I could feel the eyes of all those present
                  attempting to sear me, but failing.</p>

                <p>The Judge looked down at me and rambled on about my cruelties and resentment for man. The entire time he
                  droned I stood with the thought that the death penalty was illegal in this state. It was utterly satisfying
                  to know the uproarious crowds calling for my head when the law wouldnât allow it. I snapped out of it when
                  he got to the sentence.</p>

                <p>âSeeing as how the death penalty is illegal in this state, I can only do the most with that in light. I hereby
                  sentence you to one thousand and one life sentences.â</p>

                <p>He was being melodramatic. Not in history had there been such an absurd sentence. What's worse, The number
                  was uneven. Meaning the rest of my life I would have to say one thousand and ONE when discussing my sentence.
                  He knew this.</p>

                <p>My demeanor slightly shaken, I asked the Judge, âWhy 1000 and one?â</p>

                <p>The courtroom was silent. The families, friends and jury looked at me with contempt, but that didnât matter
                  then, even less now.</p>

                <p>The Judge leaned over his podium. He smiled with a smugness that still boils my blood and he calmly replied...
                  âTo torment you.â
                </p>

                <p>Thatâs how I got where I am now. I donât interact with the other inmates or the guards. I just mind my business
                  as best I can. I donât like to think about my sentence because it makes me itch. Similar to when you havenât
                  paid a certain bill, but donât have the funds. Itâs a wincing, mental discomfort.</p>

                <p>I write the rest of this in a testament to what happened yesterday in hopes it reaches someone on the outside.
                  My day started normally. A loud bell rang and I stood to my feet. From there, my door opened and I walked
                  to the shower facility. I tried to find myself at the end of the line so as to get the most time out of
                  my cell. I also like my privacy. The inmates here are insufferable. They are uneducated criminals who would
                  have no life outside of these walls. My fellow black inmates gave me hell for being âcrazyâ since African
                  American serial killers are considered such an abnormality. The other races tended to stay to themselves,
                  minus a few Aryan brotherhood members casting the occasional slur my direction. I entered the shower as
                  normal, but I felt an innate sense of dread that I donât know how to describe. I just felt... unpleasant.
                  I felt watched and alone at the same time. I felt completely hopeless and near despair. I quickly finished
                  my shower and left the facility. The halls were quiet and the stationary guard was not at his post in front
                  of my cell. I was alone in this hallway.</p>

                <p>Suddenly, I felt a large hand grip my shoulder and order me forward. The next thing I knew I was being escorted
                  to the Wardenâs office. I was somewhat stunned, but complied.</p>

                <p>I walked the tight enclosed halls until I reached the last room on the right. Inside was totally dark apart
                  from a dim lamp illuminating a desk. The hand shoved me in and slammed the door behind me.</p>

                <p>I saw the silhouette of Warden and he beckoned me to sit. I sat across from him in uncomfortable silence.
                  He didnât move and neither did I. I would force him to make the first move.</p>

                <p>After what felt like an eternity he spoke up.</p>

                <p>âLetâs go over your file.â His voice carried, a mild southern accent sprinkled in.</p>

                <p>I did not respond. He gave no indication as to why, so I would bide my time.</p>

                <p>From here I will paraphrase what was said, as my memory canât perfectly recreate the entire conversation.</p>

                <p>âCount 1. Confessed. Not convicted. Man falls off cliff and you assist him in passing. You were 12 so it
                  wasnât included in your final file, but it warrants mentioning.</p>

                <p>Count 2. Confessed. Convicted. You confessed to shoving a young woman off a roof and then robbing her home
                  of a trophy. You were 18</p>

                <p>Count 3. Confessed Convicted. Homeless man near your college, you stabbed him and cut out a tooth. You were
                  20
                </p>

                <p>Count 4. Confessed. Not Convicted. You claim to have shot a prostitute in Texas. The souvenir you took could
                  not link you to the crime and she had no family. You were 24. Not convicted, but you know what you did.</p>

                <p>Counts 5 through 9. Confessed. Convicted on all counts. You killed five lot lizards before changing your
                  MO. That was smart. They were all strangled and you kept a lock of hair. Left them on the highway.</p>

                <p>Count 10. Confessed. Convicted. You took a lost 12-year-old and drowned him. You kept his retainer. You were
                  doing well in life by this point, but murder still called. Didnât it?</p>

                <p>Count 11. Confessed. Convicted. Ah, this one was special wasnât she? That Gas station employee who you stalked
                  for a while? Followed her home and broke in. Took your time and did it right. She broke your perfect streak
                  and you were going to make her pay right? Kept her locket as a token of your affection.</p>

                <p>Count 12. Confessed. Convicted. You took a young man to your from a local club in Missouri. Strangled him
                  the moment the door was closed. Chopped him up and kept his teeth.</p>

                <p>Counts 13 through 17. Confessed. Convicted on all counts. The Hitchhiker phase. Here it seems you just wanted
                  to close the gap. You got sloppy. Left a lot of evidence behind. I guess because they were vagrants it
                  wouldnât have mattered.</p>

                <p>Count 18. Confessed. Convicted. You killed a Housewife in Florida. You were on vacation at them time. You
                  spotted her and just had to do something. Waiting until her husband left and had yourself a time. Another
                  rape and strangling. You took her bloodsoaked necklace.</p>

                <p>Count 19. Confessed. Convicted. You saw a jogger one morning and followed in your truck. When you knew their
                  routine you waited in the bushes until he passed. You killed him with a hammer and took one of his shoes.</p>

                <p>Count 20. Confessed. Convicted. The one that brought you down. You couldnât resist her. You were too careless.
                  Too excited. Now youâre here. You took her glasses and bashing her head in and assaulting her.â</p>

                <p>He took a deep breathe and his outline sat back.</p>

                <p>âDo you know you know what they call you?â He asked me incredulously.</p>

                <p>I was livid. He completely bastardized my work. I had done so much and he swept over it like an obituary
                  column. I glared at him in the dark before answering, âThe Scavenger Hunt Killer?â</p>

                <p>I hated that name. They donned me the Scavenger Hunt Killer because my murders spanned so far and I collected
                  odd, disconnected items. Again, my works and efforts were reduced to a joke. It still makes me sick. The
                  warden spoke up again, âAre you sorry?â
                </p>

                <p>I sat for a moment before responding, âWould it matter?â He chuckled in a deep throaty laugh. âNo,â He said
                  settling in, âI guess it wouldnât.â</p>

                <p>He continued, âI donât get it really. Youâre a highly intelligent, healthy and well spoken man, why on earth
                  would you throw that away?â</p>

                <p>I sat in angry silence. I refused to give this man the satisfaction of an answer.</p>

                <p>âDo you believe in God?â The Warden asked, his tone now changed.</p>

                <p>I chewed my tongue before responding, âNo.â</p>

                <p>âPity,â he responded lackadaisically, as if my response didnât really matter, âThat would make what Iâm about
                  to tell you much better.â</p>

                <p>I waited for him to continue.</p>

                <p>âYour sentence is being commuted.â</p>

                <p>I raised an eyebrow in disbelief, âreally?â</p>

                <p>âYes,â He sat, still shadowed, but I knew he was smirking.</p>

                <p>âWhat does that have to do with God?â</p>

                <p>I know I should have had much more important questions to ask in that moment, but I was curious. I assumed
                  he meant I should be thankful.</p>

                <p>âWell,â he said, his voice trailing, âThat would make this next part easier. You passed away this morning,
                  son.â Before I could respond, his hand tossed a few photos in front of me.</p>

                <p>It was me. I lay covered in blood on the shower floor. I had been stabbed from the looks of it.</p>

                <p>âYeah,â The Warden, or who I thought was the warden spoke up, âsome Aryan fellow wanted to prove his might
                  by stabbing a serial killer to death in the shower. Didnât work though, since he was caught and will most
                  likely be in solitary until it does irreparable damage. If thatâs some comfort.â</p>

                <p>I stared at him. I stared at the photographs.</p>

                <p>I simple could not accept it.</p>

                <p>âThis is absurd,â I felt insulted and the prospect.</p>

                <p>âI know it seems odd, but hear me out,â He sat upright, ready to make his case, âDo you know what the Universalists
                  are?â
                </p>

                <p>âNoâ</p>

                <p>âWell,â He continued without missing a beat. âBasically it states that everyone gets into heaven. Even if
                  you arenât necessarily in their denomination.â</p>

                <p>âThis is heaven?â I was ready to laugh. This was a joke.</p>

                <p>âNo, see thatâs the bad news,â He continued, âCatholics, Muslims, some Buddhists, see they believe in a temporal
                  plane so theyâre also sort of right. See everyone does eventually move on, but before anyone can move on,
                  they must resolve all their earthly obligations... and judgments."</p>

                <p>Before I could remark, he caught his breath and explained further.</p>

                <p>âYou died this morning. You served ONE of your 1001 life sentences. Welcome to number 2."</p>

                <p>I stood up, âThis isnât funny. Iâm leaving.â</p>

                <p>I couldn't move. I was frozen in place. Unable to use my body. My eyes felt like they were being pried towards
                  the seat.</p>

                <p>âPlease,â I heard The Warden, though his voice was now much deeper, sinking my gut, âsit.â I returned to
                  my seat with a sensation that was new to me: fear.</p>

                <p>âNow,â he continued, his voice returning to normal, âYou are
                  <em>not</em> dead. You just started another sentence. Everything will be back to normal when you leave. When
                  I dismiss you, you will leave here and return to your bunk, do you understand?â</p>

                <p>I nodded. Still stunned by what I then knew as truth. His voice. The unexplained dread I felt that morning.</p>

                <p>I walked out of the Wardenâs office that day, feeling a hopelessness I have never known. The prison was the
                  same, but it wasnât. It was lonelier. Darker.</p>

                <p>That feels like forever ago. I learned since then.</p>

                <p>First, âLifetimeâ does not mean from the age you are incarcerated. I expected a 40-year âlifeâ sentence.
                  But after speaking with a few other inmates serving like myself, who I see sometimes sparingly, I learned
                  that it varies somewhere from 80 to 120 years. It varies, but it is always at least 80. </p>

                <p>I guess the guards don't notice after a certain point. Also, I assume they don't register that we never seem
                  to leave. Inexplicable, but that's what's happening.</p>

                <p>Second, each go around... changes you. The prisoners don't notice you. The others like you have fewer words.
                  The guards seemed always outside of the line of sight, even when they would interact. They were like fleeting
                  shadows. </p>

                <p>I am cracking mentally. I will walk into the showers and see someone shaving, even speak with him at length.
                  However, when I turn a corner or close a stall door, heâll be gone when I return. </p>

                <p>Next, I learned that suicide doesnât work. I learned the same way every inmate in here like me does. I slit
                  my wrists and they just ached for a week. I swallowed bleach and had a miserable stomachache, but no death.
                  I hung myself where I choked and flailed, fully conscious, for 8 straight hours until a guard found me
                  while bringing my breakfast the following morning.
                </p>

                <p>I learned that being murdered decreases time, but murdering adds it, so no one on life row attempts murder
                  here.
                </p>

                <p>Finally, escaping isn't an option. We have runners sometimes. Men, who just finished their first sentence.
                  The guy just snapped. I guess he pulled maybe 60 years before dying in his sleep. He just panicked and
                  ran. The snipers didn't even turn. He grabbed the fence and immediately fell to the ground. From there
                  he shook violently. He died right there of a heart attack.</p>

                <p>I saw him a week later. 3rd life sentence. Half crippled. I guess we get punished if we try to leave. I don't
                  know if its permanent. He was a wreck upon returning. It reminded me of the cats in my neighborhood as
                  a boy. The first time you hurt it, the animal twitches and becomes neurotic, but given enough time, it
                  accepts its fate. The man now spends his days staring silently behind dead eyes at whatever light source
                  is around.</p>

                <p>To some this is limbo. Where we remain trapped in the prison in which we were condemned until our body, and
                  soul, have finished their sentences. To others this is some kind of purgatory. Where we are groomed for
                  eternity in paradise. Either way, we are forced to remain, forced to live until we pay our dues. Never
                  truly dying.</p>

                <p>I don't even know if time is the same now, but if you're reading this I managed to successfully get these
                  pages out. </p>

                <p>I have handful of plans, which I cannot record. I cannot risk ant future attempts should this fail.</p>

                <p>Iâm leaving this journal for anyone who is a criminal or wants to become one. I have between 80,000 too=
                  100,000 years left. I do not feel remorse, but I do wish I knew then what I know now. This is simply a
                  warning.
                </p>

                <p>100,000 years on a concrete slab. A hard, unforgiving surface.</p>

                <p>100,000 years with one hour a day in a dying earthscape I barely recognize. </p>

                <p>100,000 years of sickly green floors and cold steel doors that move for nothing.</p>

                <p>100,000 years of mopping floors, or scrubbing toilets </p>

                <p>100,000 years of being monitored by beings I cannot fully comprehend as their burning horror erupts in the
                  back of my mind.</p>

                <p>1001 life sentences.</p>

                <p>1000 to go.</p>

                <p>Only one small thing gives me comfort.</p>

                <p>With 1000 life sentences at least itâs a nice a clean number.</p>

                <p>I hope I donât die too soon and ruin this nice, even lifetime...</p>

                <p>...because the next one will be hell.</p>

                <p>To be honest, I've always been against it since I was first introduced to it. I think COD4 was the first
                  game with it that I sunk time into.</p>

                <p>I preferred the less customized class choice approach in earlier CODs (and MOHAA and other games). We don't
                  have to go that far back. We can still have custom loadouts imo, but the whole progression in pvp has gotten
                  out of hand.</p>

                <ol>
                  <li>First, it doesn't belong. PVP games should be an even playing field. Not "award those who play the most"
                    Unlocks and progression should be tied to character and story development. Not found in pvp shooters.
                  </li>
                  <li>When games do have them, they're not even balanced anymore. If EA Battlefront (1) was a free2play game
                    people would be like "what the hell? My starting loadout is weak. I don't even have grenades. Nevermind
                    sniper rifles or jet packs that offer huge advantages.

                    <ul>
                      <li>Now we've moved one step further into, loot crates/buying progression</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Head over to hear what the COD:WWII community, its a huge list of "I'm not getting enough points for kills
                    in &lt;game mode&gt;"

                    <ul>
                      <li>Why does that even matter? I don't know what happened to just playing a game for the sake of the gameplay.
                        It actually forces developers to improve their games.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Even as a Battlefield fan, I love what BF4 became in its life, but holy hell do I hate the idea of hundreds
                    of different guns to unlock to try out, and then unlock the attachments. And the community saying "Increase
                    max rank! I got to max rank and stop playing" Why does that drive you? Its not even the slightest thought
                    in the back of my head when I'm playing. I don't get it.</li>
                  <li>There must be something psychologically exploitative about it. These types of games, become about the unlocks
                    and progression... and when its over, it has players asking the developers to add more stuff they can
                    buy... make a new game they can buy to start all over again. And that is in a big way how we got to where
                    we are now.</li>
                  <li>
                    <p>We look at some of the most popular, strongest, growing communities on PC..</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>CSGO</li>
                      <li>Overwatch</li>
                      <li>PUBG</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>No progression or unlocks in site. (Yes they have loot crates and people are against them, but they are
                      strictly cosmetic only. But this isn't really about that use) These games are heavily carried by their
                      gameplay, and communities.</p>
                  </li>
                </ol>

                <p>Probably not going to please everybody... A lot of people do play these shooters for the progression. To
                  me, I feel like they need to be shown a different way.. i.e. Did they play shooters before that progression
                  was a thing? That's a time when I enjoyed them the most and put in the most hours personally.</p>

                <p>Or the games need to change. It would make sense to me, if one of these guys, whether its EA/Star Wars, COD,
                  Battlefield... tried a Destiny/MMO approach. Instead of single player, do a COOP looter shooter.. There
                  you can put your ranks/progression. But once you head into the pvp battle, put that aside and even the
                  playing field. (Not perfect though, people like to use their own stuff in pvp as well. Just thinking out
                  loud really)</p>

              <div class="postDropdown6">
                <p>I was born two years before the first great war.
                  <br> My father was, of course, conscripted to fight across the sea against Germany â where he lost his life
                  in some bloody conflict on foreign soil. This left my mother to raise myself and my two sisters on her
                  own, something which was very difficult in those times.
                  <br> By the time I was twelve, I had two part-time jobs and no time for school; I considered myself a young
                  man â my fatherâs replacement, if you like â and books, letters and numbers only concerned me if they facilitated
                  more money in my threadbare pockets.
                  <br> Our family struggled. My mother sought to remarry, but men were in short supply after the war; nor did
                  any man care to burden himself with three children when he could find a woman with none.
                  <br> Yet somehow we survived. I learned to exist on as little sleep as possible, often less than four hours
                  a night, which meant I could work longer hours and more jobs.
                  <br> By the time I saw my sixteenth year on this earth, I had secured a good job in the mines, where I could
                  use my considerable strength to great advantage.
                  <br> But then the Great Depression hit us. </p>

                <p>&nbsp;
                  <br> Industry suffered immediately and many workers were laid off.
                  <br> I kept my job for a year before the mine closed, bankrupt; and so with my fatherâs hat on my head and
                  my smartest coat about my shoulders, I joined the growing queues outside the workhouses.
                  <br> In some ways, I think our prior poverty helped us. None of my family were proud, and all of us were used
                  to tightening our belts during lean times. We were well accustomed to working whilst the pangs of hunger
                  wracked our guts, and we had long ago set aside any petty pride that might see us eschew scavenging amongst
                  mine tailings for unburnt coal, or waiting outside grimy soup kitchens.
                  <br> I did as much work as I could, but it was in short supply in those hard times. Some days there was so
                  little work that the crowds of men would grow restless and violent, taking their frustrations out on one
                  another because there was no other outlet available.
                  <br> No one drank liquor â no man could afford to â and only the âearthierâ pleasures were left to us; brawling,
                  gambling and fornication. Disease was rife, especially syphilis, and the work and food became ever more
                  scarce. My sisters picked mushrooms and wild berries in the forest, but it was never enough, so our stomachs
                  would continue to growl through the watery soups and fried potato-peelings.
                  <br> When my mother became gravely ill during winter, we suffered even more. Her wages as a part-time maid
                  were all that had kept our heads above water.
                  <br> When she lost her job, I thought we had reached the end.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;
                  <br> There was no end to the travelling tinkers and traders in those times â mobile pawn shops thrived, ready
                  to buy up family heirlooms for a pittance, then take them south, where the richer folk could afford frivolous
                  luxuries.
                  <br> We had sold all such fripperies long ago â and certainly had no money to
                  <em>buy</em> anything â but I still liked to look at their wares and pretend, imagining what it would be like
                  to have money in my pocket.
                  <br> Which was how I met the trader who sold me the bottle.
                  <br> He was a small thing and was likely ninety if he was a day, but he was as spry as a gentleman sparrow
                  in his grey and brown hat and coat, his wrinkled face curiously young and animated.
                  <br> âCare to buy something for a lady friend?â he said, his cheerful voice raking across nerves raw with hunger
                  and lack of sleep.
                  <br> âNo sir,â I told him, âI havenât any spare coin. I just like to look.â
                  <br> âAh, well,â he replied, âno harm in that. But while you look, would you like to hear a story?â
                  <br> âI have no objections to that, sir.â
                  <br> And so he began to tell me a fantastic story, of how he had found a magic bottle that had changed his
                  life. He claimed to have been, at one point, a Victorian nobleman, and at another the Mayor of a respectable
                  town â all thanks to his magic bottle.
                  <br> Which he was, of course, willing to sell to me.
                  <br> âA pretty fable,â I told him, âbut sir, donât take me for some witless syphilitic. Iâll not buy your foolâs
                  gold.â
                  <br> âA loan then,â he told me, âIâll give you the bottle for three days â and if you do not wish to buy it
                  after that, then you may return it at no cost.â
                  <br> I should have known better than to accept his offer; I knew something was
                  <em>off</em> about this elderly dandy and his bottle-fiction. But hunger and privation abrade the soul down
                  to its most tender, vulnerable layers, leaving us wide open to clever hucksters and charlatans such as
                  these.
                  <br> So I accepted.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;
                  <br> The bottle appeared to be made of smooth, opaque white glass, though at some point it had been carved
                  with whorls and patterns which had been nearly worn away by hundreds of hands. The peddler claimed that
                  it was Arabian rock quartz â carved all from one piece â and that once it had housed a mystic Djinn of
                  great power.
                  <br> When pressed on the matter of the magical creature, he claimed that it had been liberated from the bottle
                  by its master â but that a curious power still lingered in the thing.
                  <br> I gathered there would be no three wishes for me.
                  <br> Holding the bottle in my hands after I finished work for the day, I recalled his instructions;
                  <br> âPlace your palms on either side of the vessel, and imagine your weariness settling to the bottom of your
                  skull like a great ball of phlegm. Then, when you feel it beginning to slide into the back of your throat,
                  <em>spit</em> all of your tiredness and fatigue into the bottle.â
                  <br> I did as he instructed â and to my surprise, I felt the liquid mass of
                  <em>sleep</em> dislodge from my brain and begin to slide down my throat.
                  <br> With a great gurgle and a mighty
                  <em>hock</em>, I managed to half-vomit the stuff into the bottle.
                  <br> Immediately I felt as fresh and awake as if Iâd had four hoursâ hard sleep.
                  <br> The Djinn Bottle was genuine.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;
                  <br> For three days I worked around the clock, scraping in just enough extra coin to survive. All men had to
                  sleep, so most had to choose either day or night work â but with the bottle in my possession, I could do
                  <em>both</em>.
                  <br> That little bit of extra money allowed me to buy medicine for my mother, and bread for my sisters â both
                  an absolute Godsend in those desperate times.
                  <br> When the peddler arrived at my doorstep, inquiring about the bottle, I told him that I would buy it.
                  <br> âYou have heard my story of ownership,â he said, âand now I must tell you that the bottle can only be
                  sold to you for
                  <em>all the money you have</em>. That is the rule of transference.â
                  <br> I laughed then, for I imagined that for some, that would be too steep a price. For myself, it was a pittance.
                  All I had left in my pockets was a halfpenny â which I gave to the man and took the bottle.
                  <br> With a nod and a tip of his neat hat, he reminded me that every few days I should drink the stored contents
                  within, to buy off my sleep debt.
                  <br> âElse you will eventually go mad,â he cautioned, âfor no man should ever go without sleep for too long.â
                  <br> Holding the bottle in my hands that night, I felt like I had swindled him â that I had won some great
                  victory over the fates.
                  <br> For with the bottle, my family had a
                  <em>chance</em> to get through these terrible times.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;
                  <br> I worked any job they could give me, night or day.
                  <br> Nothing was too lowly for me; rat catcher, night soil man, gravedigger â all the jobs that people preferred
                  to stay unseen, or that were simply best done under the cover of darkness.
                  <br> But I could
                  <em>also</em> work day shifts, as lively as if Iâd slept all night.
                  <br> It became my routine to work six days straight, accumulating all my sleep debt into the bottle, then on
                  the first minute of Sunday morning â the Sabbath â I would put it to my lips and drink the thin, foul-tasting
                  grey slime that rested inside.
                  <br> Then I would sleep for a
                  <em>full day</em>.
                  <br> We certainly didnât thrive, but we survived. The eldest of my younger sisters married, becoming her husbandâs
                  responsibility. I was always able to find work, and became known as âthe man who never sleepsâ.
                  <br> As the Great Depression began to ease and we began to grow hopeful about the future again, a
                  <em>new</em> calamity befell us all.
                  <br> The Second World War. </p>

                <p>&nbsp;
                  <br> Like my father before me, I was conscripted to fight on foreign soil against enemies with whom I personally
                  had no quarrel.
                  <br> But unlike my father, I did not die.
                  <br> While all the other soldiers suffered from broken sleep and freakish nightmares due to the endless shellings,
                  the roar of machine guns and the drone of plane engines, I had the bottle.
                  <br> I tried to use it wisely, to keep to the established routine. But no man can sleep for twenty-four hours
                  during a war, and so instead of using the bottle, I began
                  <em>abusing</em> it.
                  <br> A few weeks passed, with no change. I felt nothing.
                  <br> After two months, it became more difficult to get the sleep out of my skull; the grey liquid thicker now,
                  like the solid snot one might get from a terrible headcold. As I coughed and retched it into the bottle,
                  I dreaded having to drink it down once this madness was all over.
                  <br> If my mood changed and I became grimmer, laughing less and smiling never, my fellow conscripts said nothing.
                  It was
                  <em>war</em> and it was detrimentally affecting us all.
                  <br> Sentry duty became a permanent part of my life. The legend of the stone-faced soldier who never slept
                  was a quiet one in the trenches, but it reached the officers nonetheless. I received a field promotion
                  and was put in charge of a squad, then that squad breached a vital point of the enemy lines, and I was
                  again promoted.
                  <br> There was blood sliding into the bottle now, mixing with the thick grey ooze that vanished into the opaque,
                  apparently bottomless container. I no longer felt much of
                  <em>anything</em>, not fatigue, not pain, not grief, and most certainly not joy.
                  <br> When I was eventually cut down in an ambush and sent back to the field hospital, I knew it was time to
                  drink from the bottle.
                  <br> Lifting it to my lips with my good arm, I saw two tiny chips on the crystalline surface â as though it
                  had been hit by gunfire and the bullets had simply
                  <em>bounced off</em> it.
                  <br> But as I drank and drank the oily, diseased-smelling black-grey fluid from the bottle, I quickly forgot
                  about it. Heavy weariness began to settle over me, and blessed
                  <em>sleep</em> finally returned to my life.</p>

                <p>&nbsp; </p>

                <hr>

                <p>&nbsp;
                  <br> I am told that the coma lasted five months.
                  <br> When I finally awoke, in a hospital bed back home, I was as weak as a kitten and so groggy I could barely
                  string three words together.
                  <br> On the table beside the bed was a spray of wildflowers â placed carefully into the Djinn Bottle.
                  <br> It was in that moment that all of the war came crashing back in on me.
                  <br> They said I screamed for three hours, even long after they gagged me, then sedated me. Only their strongest
                  medications finally paralysed me enough that I could no longer vocalise the horrors I had witnessed.
                  <br> There were
                  <em>things</em> that I had done, all that I now remembered. Things that, under the influence of the bottle,
                  had appeared perfectly seemly, and perfectly logical.
                  <br> But in the cold light of day, no longer beholden to the fugue that had afflicted my mind, I no longer
                  saw those actions as such.
                  <br> The shaking hand that I now held up in front of my eyes had pressed a gun to the heads of German children,
                  then pulled the trigger, sending their brains and hair spraying into the dust behind them. These same hands
                  had calmly and decisively shot several of my own men for insubordination, strangled men I disliked in their
                  sleep, and torn the clothes from any woman I decided I wanted.
                  <br> The monstrous things I had done echoed around and around inside my skull, giving me no leeway, no reprieve.
                  The hospital, ill-equipped to treat my madness, sent me to a sanatorium to recover, where I immediately
                  threw the bottle into the adjacent river, cursing it for how it had deceived me.
                  <br> But the next morning the damnable thing sat on my dresser, beside my bed.
                  <br> No matter where I hurled it, or how many times I paid people to take it away from me, it
                  <em>kept</em> coming back.
                  <br> It was inescapable.
                  <br> And so too were the nightmares.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;
                  <br> In my dreams, I relived the things I had done. My bloody hands ravaged and reeved, killing and tormenting
                  scores of innocents.
                  <br> It was, I felt, fitting penance for my actions â and so I bore the torment with as much good grace as
                  possible.
                  <br> But the bottle was not done with me yet.
                  <br> Other wars began to creep into my dreams, wars in which I had never taken part. At first they were fought
                  with cannon and rifle, then musket and sword. When I dreamed of impaling men upon a great iron pike and
                  laughing until my jaws ached, I knew that I was reliving more than just my own lifetimeâs demons.
                  <br> Morphine took the edge off, but it couldnât quell the nightmares any more than hard liquor could.
                  <br> And so, inevitably, I succumbed to the bottle again.
                  <br> After two years, I didnât even miss sleep.
                  <br> After five, I began to forget that it existed.
                  <br> By now, the
                  <em>stuff</em> that slithered out of my mind was black as tar and just as thick, oozing obscenely into the
                  neck of the bottle like some giant, primeval slug.
                  <br> And the bottle began to grow
                  <em>heavy</em>. </p>

                <p>&nbsp;
                  <br> When the coppers came to my home for bashing my mistress dead with a fire-iron, I brained the first with
                  the weighty Djinn Bottle, then shot the other through the heart with my pistol. Cold and rational, realising
                  that I would be sent to prison, I walked to the docks and booked immediate passage away from my homeland,
                  leaving my two sisters and now elderly mother behind.
                  <br> Knowing distantly that the bottle was to blame, I stopped vomiting the tar of sleep into it â and instead
                  began to swallow it, determined to find a way to break the curse of the bottle.
                  <br> Things became very strange from there.
                  <br> I recall a fever; sweating and tossing in my bunk as the ship rose and fell in the swells. Strange, half-mad,
                  half-awake nightmares assaulted me â insane dreams in which the crew had become undead things that thirsted
                  for my flesh and blood. I ran from them, fought them, gibbered at them and screamed at them until they
                  stopped coming for me. Eventually I lay on the deck of the ship, raving at the incessant sunlight that
                  scalded and blistered my face and lips.
                  <br> I came to my senses when a heavy rain broke my fever, dribbling blessed fresh water down my parched throat.
                  When I roused proper, I found that the ship was deserted, rolling rudderless and without sail in the shallows
                  of an unknown cove.
                  <br> But the blood spattering the deck and the cabins told me everything I needed to know about the fate of
                  the absent crew.
                  <br> The bottle had won again. </p>

                <p>&nbsp;
                  <br> In the new country, I came quickly to money and power.
                  <br> No longer beholden to the moralities of other men, and gifted with eternal wakefulness by the bottle,
                  I was a force to be reckoned with. All my wildest desires had come true; eventually the bottle granted
                  me wine, women and wealth.
                  <br> It could not, however, grant me wisdom.
                  <br> Nor could it bring me
                  <em>joy</em>.
                  <br> At the age of seventy, nary a line upon my face and as fit as a man of thirty, I felt a single, genuine
                  emotion for the first time in a very, very long while.
                  <em>Fear</em>.
                  <br> It is difficult for me to describe to you in writing the depthless terror I experienced in that moment.
                  The bottle was not just an accursed object, tempting me with a power I shouldnât possess, it was
                  <em>an eternal trap</em>.
                  <br> After all, it had been crafted to be nothing more than a magical prison for an ageless and unfathomable
                  entity.
                  <br> I realised then that there was only one release from that trap: to pass the bottle on to another. I also
                  realised that to do so, I would first need to
                  <em>empty</em> the bottle â to drink that black essence of decades of pent-up slumber â and to render myself
                  helpless for only God knew how long.
                  <br> But there was no other way. I knew that the bottle could not be broken, brokered or borrowed until it
                  was empty.
                  <br> So I sold everything that I owned, put it in trust, and purchased a bed in a private hospital, where I
                  pressed the evil bottle to my shrinking lips, and drank down all of my debt.</p>

                <p>&nbsp; </p>

                <hr>

                <p>&nbsp;
                  <br> I am told that this is the year twenty-sixteen â that the millennium came and went without the return
                  of the Lord, and without any of the predicted cataclysms.
                  <br> The bottle is empty, and as light as the day I bought it, the faint ridges and whorls of the stone quartz
                  more familiar to my hand than even my own face. I have not used it since I awoke â for I cannot; the instant
                  that I do so, it will again ensnare my mind and I will be damned to this existence for all eternity.
                  <br> But, unlike the peddler who foisted this cursed thing onto me, I do not need to roam from village to village,
                  telling my story day after day and being turned away by suspicious and wary strangers until I find some
                  soul desperate enough to buy it.
                  <br> For with this new age has come the phenomenon of this
                  <em>Internet</em>; a global telegram network that reaches into every home, every workplace and every dark corner
                  of the world.
                  <br> So now, my friend, you have heard my story.
                  <em>My</em> part of the bargain is complete.
                  <br> All you need do is give me
                  <em>all the money you have</em>, and the Djinn Bottle is yours.
                  <br> With your intelligence, your educated savvy and your worldly ways, Iâm quite sure that you can conquer
                  the curse of the bottle where I could not. </p>

                <p>I eagerly await your messages.</p>

              <div class="postDropdown14">
                <p>Her name was Alice: a short, white, Wisconsin girl with wavy brown hair and an ever-present Packers jacket.
                  She liked pad thai and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. She gushed over black and white movies. She couldnât dance
                  if her life depended on it. And she caused one of the most terrifying years of my life.</p>

                <p>Whoops, am I right?</p>

                <p>I was heading to this weekly improv show, but my friend whom I usually went with was out of town, so I posted
                  an open invite on a university Facebook group. I got exactly one response, from this random girl, Alice,
                  but my socially awkward ass was all over it. She came to the show and we hit it off big time. Cue the coffee
                  meetups, the Netflix binges, blah blah blah, we started dating. Life was pretty good for a while.</p>

                <p>Then came the first messages, a lovely series of blurbs from a man named Eric. His profile picture was a
                  skinny guy in thick-rimmed glasses with a hoodie, a beanie, and his tongue sticking out of his open smile.
                  This becomes important later, trust me. For now, whatâs important is this spattering of angry Facebook
                  DMs from this man I had never met, detailing why Iâm not a good boyfriend, and that Iâm hurting Alice,
                  and how I just donât understand her like he does.</p>

                <p>I was a bit annoyed but mostly confused. I talked to Alice about it, but she just handwaved it away. Heâs
                  a jerk, she said, I donât hang out with him anymore. It wasnât the most satisfying explanation, but aggressively
                  jealous guys arenât exactly an anomaly, so I just blocked him and thought that was the end of it.</p>

                <p>A few months passed by. Summer came and went. Alice had planned to study abroad so when I came back to school,
                  she was already halfway across the world. It was only a few months, I thought. No big deal.</p>

                <p>Over those next few months, I would become Facebook acquainted with a myriad of strange individuals.</p>

                <p>There was Leah. Her FB profile was just a FB silhouette icon. She sent an array of messages justifying Ericâs
                  anger, reiterating that my relationship with Alice was unhealthy and toxic, and that Alice and Eric have
                  much better history. She also included a blurry photo of a girl sitting on top of and making out with a
                  skinny guy. Both of their faces were obscured, but Leah swore it was Alice and Eric from sometime during
                  the summer.</p>

                <p>There was Nick. FB pic was a guy on a skateboard in front of a sunset. He readily admitted that he had feelings
                  for Alice, but made clear that neither he nor Eric had any right to be upset about her not being with them.
                  He said that Leah and Eric were liars and heâd try to set them straight. Relative to the others, he seemed
                  semi-ok, but he let slip a few really bitter-sounding messages. He sounded like a loose cannon, always
                  a little on edge.</p>

                <p>There was Hannah. FB pic: two silhouetted girls in front of a sunset. She showed up after I blocked Leah.
                  She claimed to be a childhood friend of Alice. Cue the same old your-relationship-is-bad shit.</p>

                <p>There was Chris. FB pic: a white blond boy in sunglasses. Very elusive. He would send one cryptic message
                  every once in a blue moon. Heâd never reply to any of my messages.</p>

                <p>There was Mark. FB pic: two pairs of feet, one male, one female. He apologized for the actions of the others.
                  He tried to fill me in on the groupâs dynamics and history. In the physical absence of Alice, he offered
                  to meet me to talk. Like an idiot, I agreed. We set a time and place. He never showed up and I never heard
                  from him again.</p>

                <p>There was Sarah. There was David. There were so many.</p>

                <p>This was all spread over a period of time. Usually I blocked or stopped hearing from one person before hearing
                  from another. Digital harassment after digital harassment, with some vague threats sprinkled in.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, Alice is extremely difficult to get a hold of. I chalk this up to vastly different time zones,
                  but even when I do hear from her, sheâs really dismissive of the whole subject. I donât know what to do,
                  she said.</p>

                <p>And then I get an accusation. One day, she sends me the question, Whoâs Mary?</p>

                <p>I tell her the truth, that I don't know who Mary is. She sends me screenshots of texts she received from
                  an unknown number. In them, the sender wrote that her name is Mary, and that she is in love me. He told
                  me he loved me, Mary wrote, he had sex with me and now he has not called me back.</p>

                <p>If you feel like this story is rapidly losing focus, itâs because it is. There were so many disparate things
                  going on and I could not for the life of me understand why. At that point, I was just about losing my mind.
                  But this is where things get beyond crazy.</p>

                <p>I started to get texts from Mary. She asked why I hadnât called her. She asked if I meant what I said to
                  her. She told me sheâd come to me. She said she had seen me on campus, here, there, at this event, at this
                  particular time. And anytime she said she had seen me in a place at a particular time, I realized that
                  I had actually been at that place at that time. I started looking over my shoulder. I didnât know what
                  I could do. I had no face, no name to report.</p>

                <p>Then I hear from Nick again. He said he found Mary. He said he tried to talk to her, and she tried to pull
                  a gun on him, but the situation was resolved, and she was now being put in treatment. Thatâs all I can
                  squeeze out of him.</p>

                <p>I am beyond confused at this point. I am beyond afraid. I call Alice. I tell her I canât do this anymore.
                  I had no clue what was going on, but I knew somehow they were all involved and I wanted no part in it.
                  I cut off contact with her.</p>

                <p>And then everything, the messages, the texts, it all stopped.</p>

                <p>A friend of mine realized something soon after. Barely any of Aliceâs friends had their faces on FB. We did
                  some digging. Ericâs pic was some photo off a Tumblr blog full of âcute nerds.â The photo of Chris, the
                  one of the white boy with sunglasses, was an obscure photo of Justin Bieber. The photo of Nick, the skateboarder,
                  was a stock photo. Hannahâs photo was art from a book ad. David was apparently a Korean pop singer. We
                  also noticed something else horrific: all of their profiles were created around the time I met Alice.</p>

                <p>To this day, I donât understand it.</p>

                <p>Fast forward two years. I get a text message from an unknown number. That number looks familiar, I think
                  to myself. And then I realize: itâs Alice. The text consists of one word: âTalk?â</p>

                <p>Sorry, Alice, but letâs not meet.</p>
